# MyReads Project

This is implementation for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.
The app realizes a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that is used to persist information as you interact with the application.

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library. The search page also has a link to / (the root URL), which leads back to the main page.
